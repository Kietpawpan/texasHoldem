Programming is a problem solving process. You need to know what you want to do, step by step, and how to ask the computer to do them. Writing a game program is a good programming practice. 

In Texas Hold'em, we know the rules of the game.
1. We have 53 cards
2. Two of them are randomly selecetd as hole cards for player A.
3. Other two hole cards for player B.
4. Other five cards are community cards: three flops, the turn, and the river.
5. Poker hands of each player are the best combinations of the five cards selected from each player's hole cards and the community cards.
6. The higher hand beats the lower one.

First, we create a game table on the computer screen. Each card is placed in the div tag, with uniquie id for each card.
